							<h2>About</h2>
							<p>We are TaroHacks, a first-year online high school and middle school hackathon with the goal of helping students learn new skills to make projects that have an impact on their communities. Although normally hackathons are daylong, in-real-life events, COVID-19 has made this difficult to do, so with this hackathon students will be able to use their skills to create something to benefit society TaroHacks will take place from August 1st to August 8th, 2020. Our hackathon aims to inspire more students of our generation to get involved and find an interest in technology and engineering even through this pandemic. We want to help promote teamwork, innovation, creativity, and collaboration to encourage students to create solutions to problems in our world. Because TaroHacks is an online hackathon, allowing students from all over the world and country to participate, but our team is based in Santa Clara, California.

									<p>This hackathon is being run by a robotics team from Santa Clara High School called FTC Team Taro. We are a seven member team from Santa Clara, California. This is our second year as an FTC team. Our team members this year are: Kavi Rajesh, Kaitlyn Nguyen, Sahana Moogi, Xavier Cairel, James Thornton, Kaushik Salem, and Mokshitaa Dhamotharan. We were formed by the <a href = "https://svefoundation.org/49ers-stem-leadership-institute/">49ers STEM Leadership Institute</a> last year, but since then have grown and changed a lot. Weâ€™ve learned a lot in the last year and hope to do even better this season. We are all students at <a href="https://santaclara.schoolloop.com/">Santa Clara High</a> and are a part of the <a href = "https://svefoundation.org/49ers-stem-leadership-institute/">49ers SLI</a> program, and we have a passion and interest in STEM and robotics.
